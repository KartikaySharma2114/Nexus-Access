# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Next.js application is currently failing to build due to multiple linting and formatting errors. These errors prevent successful deployment and need to be systematically resolved to ensure code quality and maintainability. The errors span across multiple categories including Prettier formatting violations, TypeScript strict type checking issues, unused variable warnings, and React hooks dependency issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully without linting errors, so that the application can be deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without any Prettier formatting errors
2. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without any TypeScript linting errors
3. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without any ESLint rule violations
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN all files SHALL conform to the project's formatting standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript code to use proper type annotations instead of 'any', so that type safety is maintained throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript files are compiled THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any explicit 'any' type usage
2. WHEN type checking occurs THEN all variables and function parameters SHALL have proper type definitions
3. WHEN API handlers are processed THEN all request and response objects SHALL have defined interfaces
4. WHEN error handling functions are evaluated THEN all error parameters SHALL have specific error types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables and imports to be removed, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting runs THEN the system SHALL NOT report any unused variable warnings
2. WHEN imports are analyzed THEN all imported modules SHALL be actively used in the code
3. WHEN function parameters are checked THEN all parameters SHALL be utilized within the function body
4. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL be referenced at least once in the code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React hooks to have proper dependency arrays, so that components behave predictably and avoid potential bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React hooks are analyzed THEN all useCallback hooks SHALL include all referenced dependencies
2. WHEN useEffect hooks are evaluated THEN dependency arrays SHALL be complete and accurate
3. WHEN custom hooks are checked THEN they SHALL follow React hooks rules consistently
4. WHEN hook dependencies change THEN the hooks SHALL re-execute appropriately
